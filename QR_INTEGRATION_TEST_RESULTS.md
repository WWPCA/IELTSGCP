# QR Integration Test Results - Development Phase

## Current Testing Status (Pre-Apple Developer Account)

### Available Test Routes
1. **Mobile Simulator**: `/test-mobile` - Simulates iOS app purchase flow
2. **QR Login**: `/qr-login` - Website QR authentication interface  
3. **Profile Page**: `/profile` - Shows purchased assessments after QR auth
4. **Assessment Lists**: `/assessments/<type>` - Individual assessment modules

### Test Scenario 1: Basic QR Generation & Scanning
**Status**: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

**Steps to Test**:
1. Visit `/test-mobile`
2. Click "Purchase Academic Speaking Assessment"
3. Wait for QR code modal to appear
4. Open new tab to `/qr-login`
5. Use generated QR code to authenticate

**Expected Results**:
- QR code generates within 3 seconds
- Modal displays scannable PNG image
- Website authentication redirects to profile
- Assessment appears in user's available list

### Test Scenario 2: Session Management
**Status**: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

**Steps to Test**:
1. Complete QR authentication flow
2. Close browser tab
3. Reopen website within 1 hour
4. Verify session persistence
5. Wait for 1-hour expiry and test again

**Expected Results**:
- Session persists across browser restarts
- User remains logged in for 1 hour
- After 1 hour, prompted for new QR authentication

### Test Scenario 3: Multiple Assessment Purchases
**Status**: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

**Steps to Test**:
1. Purchase Academic Speaking Assessment
2. Complete QR authentication
3. Return to mobile simulator
4. Purchase Academic Writing Assessment
5. Generate new QR code
6. Re-authenticate on website

**Expected Results**:
- Both assessments appear in profile
- New QR code includes all purchases
- User can access multiple assessment types

### Test Scenario 4: Error Handling
**Status**: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

**Steps to Test**:
1. Generate QR code, wait 11 minutes
2. Try to authenticate with expired code
3. Test invalid QR data
4. Test network interruption during auth

**Expected Results**:
- Clear error messages for expired codes
- Graceful handling of invalid data
- Retry mechanisms work properly

## Apple Developer Account Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Sandbox Testing (Days 1-2 after approval)
- Configure 4 in-app purchase products
- Create sandbox test accounts
- Test real iOS purchase flow
- Verify receipt validation

### Phase 2: TestFlight Beta (Days 3-5 after approval)
- Upload first beta build
- Invite internal testers
- Test complete purchase-to-website flow
- Gather feedback and iterate

### Phase 3: App Store Submission (Days 6-7 after approval)
- Prepare final build
- Submit for App Store review
- Monitor review status
- Prepare for launch

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (Post App Store approval)
- Deploy Lambda functions to AWS
- Configure global CDN
- Set up monitoring and analytics
- Launch marketing campaign

## Technical Architecture Notes

### Current Development Setup
- Flask server simulates Lambda backend
- In-memory storage for QR tokens and sessions
- Real QR code generation using qrcode library
- Template rendering matches production design

### Lambda Production Architecture
- Serverless functions handle all API endpoints
- DynamoDB for persistent storage
- ElastiCache for session management
- CloudFront for global distribution

### Security Considerations
- QR tokens expire in 10 minutes
- Sessions expire in 1 hour
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Secure cookie settings in production

## Next Steps During 48-Hour Wait

1. **Thoroughly test current QR flow** using available simulators
2. **Refine user experience** based on testing feedback
3. **Prepare iOS app configuration** files and certificates
4. **Create detailed deployment scripts** for AWS Lambda
5. **Finalize App Store marketing materials** and descriptions

The system is production-ready for testing. Once Apple Developer account is approved, we can immediately begin sandbox testing and move toward App Store submission.
