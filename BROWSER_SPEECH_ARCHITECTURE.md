# Browser-Based Speech Recognition Architecture

## Overview

The IELTS GenAI Prep platform now uses local browser-based speech recognition for enhanced privacy and GDPR compliance. This architecture eliminates the need to transmit audio data to external servers while maintaining high-quality conversational assessments.

## Technical Architecture

### Speech Processing Flow
1. **Browser Speech Recognition**: Uses Web Speech API for local transcription
2. **Text-Only Transmission**: Only transcribed text is sent to servers
3. **Nova Sonic Assessment**: AI processes text transcripts for real-time conversation
4. **Enhanced Privacy**: Audio never leaves user's device

### Key Components

#### Browser-Side (Client)
- **Web Speech API**: Native browser speech-to-text conversion
- **Local Processing**: All audio processing happens in browser memory
- **Voice Visualization**: Three.js particle globe responds to AI speech
- **Privacy Controls**: Immediate audio deletion after transcription

#### Server-Side (API)
- **Nova Sonic Service**: Processes text transcripts for conversational flow
- **Enhanced Nova Assessment**: Final scoring and detailed feedback
- **Browser Speech Routes**: API endpoints for text-based conversation handling

## GDPR Compliance Benefits

### Data Minimization
- **No Audio Collection**: Voice data never transmitted or stored
- **Text-Only Processing**: Only necessary transcripts are processed
- **Local Control**: Users maintain complete control over audio data

### Privacy by Design
- **Technical Prevention**: Architecture prevents audio data collection
- **Immediate Deletion**: Audio exists only during active speech recognition
- **Zero Retention**: No voice data stored anywhere in the system

### User Rights
- **Instant Control**: Users can stop speech recognition immediately
- **Transparency**: Clear notifications about local processing
- **Data Portability**: Only text transcripts are part of user data

## API Integration

### New Endpoints
- `/api/continue_conversation`: Handles browser-generated transcripts
- `/api/start_conversation`: Initiates conversational sessions
- `/api/finalize_conversation`: Generates final assessments

### Removed Dependencies
- AWS Transcribe no longer required for speaking assessments
- Audio blob processing eliminated
- Server-side audio handling removed

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
