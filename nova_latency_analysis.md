# Nova Micro Latency Analysis for India Users

## Current Configuration
- **Service:** AWS Bedrock Nova Micro
- **Region:** us-east-1 (Northern Virginia)
- **Use Case:** IELTS Writing Assessment

## Latency Analysis for India Users

### Network Latency (Round-trip)
- **India to US-East-1:** 180-250ms typical latency
- **Distance:** ~13,000 km
- **Network Hops:** 15-20 typical

### Total Response Time Breakdown
1. **Network Round Trip:** 180-250ms
2. **Nova Micro Processing:** 800-1200ms (for writing evaluation)
3. **Total Response Time:** **~1,000-1,450ms (1.0-1.5 seconds)**

## Regional Optimization Options

### Option 1: Deploy Nova Micro in Asia Pacific
- **ap-south-1 (Mumbai):** Available for Bedrock
  - Latency from India: 20-40ms
  - Total response time: **~820-1,240ms**
  - **Improvement: 180-210ms faster (18-15% reduction)**

### Option 2: Multi-Region Setup
- Primary: ap-south-1 (Mumbai) for Asian users
- Fallback: us-east-1 for global coverage
- Cost: Same per-token pricing across regions

## User Experience Impact

### Current (us-east-1)
- Writing submission → Result: 1.0-1.5 seconds
- Acceptable for async processing
- No real-time interaction needed

### With Regional Optimization (ap-south-1)
- Writing submission → Result: 0.8-1.2 seconds
- 200ms faster response
- Minimal UX improvement for writing assessment

## Recommendation

For writing assessments specifically:
- **Current us-east-1 is acceptable** because:
  1. Writing evaluation is **async** (not real-time like speaking)
  2. 1-1.5 second response is fast enough for UX
  3. Users expect a brief "thinking" time for AI evaluation
  4. Single region simplifies operations

- **Consider regional optimization only if:**
  1. Expanding to synchronous features
  2. User feedback indicates latency issues
  3. Adding more latency-sensitive features

## Cost Comparison
- **us-east-1:** $0.00015/1K input, $0.0006/1K output tokens
- **ap-south-1:** Same pricing
- **No cost difference** for regional deployment
