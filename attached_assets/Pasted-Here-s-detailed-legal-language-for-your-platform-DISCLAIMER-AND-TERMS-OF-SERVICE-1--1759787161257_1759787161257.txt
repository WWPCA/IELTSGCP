Here’s detailed legal language for your platform:

-----

## DISCLAIMER AND TERMS OF SERVICE

### 1. NATURE OF SERVICE

**1.1 AI-Powered Practice Tool**
This platform provides an artificial intelligence-based assessment service designed solely for IELTS test preparation and practice purposes. All scores, feedback, and evaluations generated by our AI model are **estimates and practice indicators only**.

**1.2 Not Official IELTS Assessment**
This service is NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to IELTS, the British Council, IDP Education, Cambridge Assessment English, or any official IELTS testing organization. Scores and feedback provided on this platform have no official standing and will not be recognized by any institution, immigration authority, or educational body.

**1.3 No Predictive Guarantee**
Practice scores obtained through this platform are not predictive of, and may differ substantially from, your actual IELTS test results. Only scores obtained through official IELTS examinations conducted by certified examiners are valid.

### 2. AI ASSESSMENT LIMITATIONS

**2.1 Inherent Variability**
You acknowledge and agree that:

- AI assessment technology has inherent limitations and may interpret responses differently than human examiners
- The AI model may evaluate the same response differently at different times due to the probabilistic nature of AI systems
- AI scoring rubrics, while based on IELTS criteria, are approximations and may not precisely replicate human examiner judgment
- Subjective elements of language assessment (such as coherence, lexical sophistication, and communicative effectiveness) are particularly challenging for AI to evaluate

**2.2 No Accuracy Warranty**
We make NO WARRANTIES, express or implied, regarding:

- The accuracy of scores relative to official IELTS standards
- The consistency of feedback across multiple assessments
- The alignment of our AI’s interpretation of IELTS rubrics with official examiner interpretation
- The suitability of our feedback for your individual learning needs

### 3. SCORE DISPUTES AND DISAGREEMENTS

**3.1 No Manual Review Available**
We do NOT offer human review, manual reassessment, or second opinions on AI-generated scores or feedback under any circumstances. All assessments are final as provided by the AI system.

**3.2 Technical Issues Only**
Disputes will only be considered for verifiable technical failures, including:

- Complete system failure to process your submission
- Audio/text not recorded or stored due to platform malfunction
- Obvious system errors (e.g., blank feedback, incomplete scoring)

Disputes will NOT be considered for:

- Disagreement with score assigned
- Disagreement with feedback content or quality
- Belief that assessment is “unfair,” “too harsh,” or “incorrect”
- Scores lower than expected or desired
- Discrepancy between practice scores and official IELTS results

**3.3 Dispute Submission Process**
To report a technical issue:

- Submit dispute within 48 hours of receiving assessment
- Provide specific evidence of technical malfunction
- Include session ID, timestamp, and description of technical failure

We will investigate reported technical issues within 5-10 business days. Our decision on whether a technical failure occurred is final and binding.

**3.4 Remedies for Technical Failures**
If we determine a legitimate technical failure prevented proper assessment, your sole remedy shall be:

- One additional assessment attempt at no charge, OR
- Refund of the fee paid for that specific failed assessment

We will NOT provide score adjustments, upgraded scores, or additional compensation under any circumstances.

**Additional Protective Measures:**

Consider also implementing:

1. **Prominent Visual Warnings**: Display disclaimer badges on every assessment result page: “AI Practice Score - Not Official IELTS”
1. **Pre-Assessment Acknowledgment**: Require users to check a box confirming understanding before each assessment session
1. **Score Display Format**: Show scores as ranges (e.g., “Estimated Band 6.0-6.5”) rather than precise numbers to emphasize uncertainty
1. **Educational Content**: Provide FAQ section explaining AI limitations and score variability
1. **Cooling-Off Period**: After score display, require 24-hour waiting period before users can submit disputes (reduces emotional responses)
1. **Jurisdiction Clause**: Specify governing law and dispute resolution venue (arbitration clause recommended)
