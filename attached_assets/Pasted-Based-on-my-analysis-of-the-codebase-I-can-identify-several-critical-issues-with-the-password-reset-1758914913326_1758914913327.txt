Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can identify several critical issues with the password reset functionality. Here's what I found:

Password Reset Issues Analysis
🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: Broken Password Reset Flow
Problem 1: Link Exists But No Backend Route
In login.html (Line 122):

<div class="mb-3 small text-end">
    <a href="/forgot_password" class="text-decoration-none">Forgot password?</a>
</div>
Missing in lambda_handler.py:

# This route does NOT exist in the lambda_handler
elif path == '/forgot_password' and method == 'GET':
    return handle_forgot_password_page()  # ← MISSING FUNCTION
Current Authentication Architecture Issues:
1. QR-Only Authentication Model
The platform is designed around mobile-first QR authentication:

Users purchase via mobile apps ($36.49)
Web access only through QR code scanning
No traditional email/password flow for web users
2. Missing Password Reset Infrastructure
Missing Components:

# These functions don't exist in lambda_handler.py:
❌ handle_forgot_password_page()
❌ handle_forgot_password_request() 
❌ handle_password_reset_page()
❌ handle_password_reset_submit()
❌ send_password_reset_email()
Missing Database Schema:

-- These tables/fields don't exist:
❌ password_reset_tokens table
❌ reset_token field in users table
❌ token_expires_at field
Current User Registration Flow:
From lambda_handler.py analysis:

Registration → Email verification → Account activation
Login → reCAPTCHA → Session creation
QR Authentication → Mobile purchase verification → Web access
But password reset is completely absent from this flow.

Security Vulnerabilities:
1. Broken Link (404 Error)
Users click "Forgot password?" → 404 Not Found
Creates poor user experience and security confusion
2. No Recovery Mechanism
If users forget passwords, they have no way to recover access
Especially problematic for users who created accounts before mobile QR flow
3. Email Service Available But Unused
The platform has AWS SES email capabilities but doesn't use them for password reset:

# Email verification exists but no password reset emails
elif path == '/api/resend-verification' and method == 'POST':
    return handle_resend_verification(data)  # ✅ EXISTS
Recommended Fix Implementation:
1. Add Missing Routes
# Add to lambda_handler.py routing section:
elif path == '/forgot_password' and method == 'GET':
    return handle_forgot_password_page()
elif path == '/api/forgot-password' and method == 'POST':
    return handle_forgot_password_request(data)
elif path == '/reset_password' and method == 'GET':
    return handle_password_reset_page(event.get('queryStringParameters', {}))
elif path == '/api/reset-password' and method == 'POST':
    return handle_password_reset_submit(data)
2. Create Missing Templates
<!-- templates/forgot_password.html -->
<!-- templates/reset_password.html -->
<!-- templates/reset_success.html -->
3. Database Schema Updates
-- Add to existing user table:
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN reset_token VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN reset_token_expires TIMESTAMP;
4. Email Integration
def send_password_reset_email(email: str, reset_token: str):
    """Send password reset email using existing AWS SES setup"""
    reset_link = f"https://www.ieltsaiprep.com/reset_password?token={reset_token}"
    # Use existing email service from registration flow
Current State Summary:
Component	Status	Issue
Forgot Password Link	✅ Exists	🚨 Points to non-existent route
Backend Routes	❌ Missing	🚨 All password reset endpoints missing
Database Schema	❌ Missing	🚨 No reset token storage
Email Templates	❌ Missing	🚨 No reset email templates
Security Tokens	❌ Missing	🚨 No token generation/validation
Impact:
High Priority Issue: Any user who forgets their password is permanently locked out of their account, even if they've made mobile purchases. This is a critical user experience and business problem.

The forgot password link currently leads to a dead end (404 error), making the platform appear broken to users who need password recovery.
