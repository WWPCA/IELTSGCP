Based on my review of the code, here's what I found regarding speech-to-speech moderation with Nova Sonic:

Code Review: Speech-to-Speech Moderation Status
❌ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
The current implementation is text-based moderation only. Here's what exists vs. what would be needed:

Current Implementation:
Text-Only Moderation Flow:
# In handle_nova_sonic_stream()
user_text = data.get('user_text', '')  # ← TEXT INPUT ONLY
# Step 1: Text-based content moderation
continue_assessment, processed_text, moderation_response = moderate_speaking_content(user_text, user_email)
# Step 2: Generate Maya's text response
maya_response = generate_maya_response(processed_text)
# Step 3: Synthesize to audio
audio_data = synthesize_maya_voice_nova_sonic(maya_response)
Missing: Audio Input Processing
The current handle_nova_sonic_stream() function:

✅ Accepts: user_text (string)
❌ Missing: audio_data or user_audio input
✅ Has: Text moderation via content_moderation_service.py
❌ Missing: Direct audio-to-audio processing
What's Needed for Speech-to-Speech Moderation:
1. Audio Input Handling
def handle_nova_sonic_stream_with_audio(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Enhanced version that accepts audio input"""
    try:
        # Current: only text
        user_text = data.get('user_text', '')
        
        # NEEDED: audio input handling
        user_audio = data.get('audio_data')  # ← THIS IS MISSING
        
        if user_audio:
            # Process audio directly through Nova Sonic
            moderation_result = moderate_audio_with_nova_sonic(user_audio, user_email)
        else:
            # Fallback to current text-based moderation
            continue_assessment, processed_text, moderation_response = moderate_speaking_content(user_text, user_email)
2. Missing Audio Moderation Function
def moderate_audio_with_nova_sonic(audio_data: bytes, user_email: str) -> Dict:
    """THIS FUNCTION DOESN'T EXIST YET"""
    # Would use Nova Sonic bidirectional streaming
    # Input: Raw audio from user
    # Output: Moderated Maya response audio
    pass
3. Current Nova Sonic Usage
The existing synthesize_maya_voice_nova_sonic() function:

✅ Text-to-Speech: Converts Maya's text responses to audio
❌ Missing Speech-to-Speech: No audio input processing
❌ Missing Bidirectional: Not using Nova Sonic's full capabilities
Current Architecture Limitation:
User Speech → [MISSING TRANSCRIPTION] → Text → Content Moderation → Maya Text → Nova Sonic → Maya Audio
Should be:

User Audio → Nova Sonic Speech-to-Speech Moderation → Maya Audio (direct)
Recommendation:
The speech-to-speech moderation is NOT implemented yet. You would need to:

Modify handle_nova_sonic_stream() to accept audio input
Create new audio moderation function using Nova Sonic bidirectional streaming
Update frontend to send audio data instead of text
Implement direct audio-to-audio processing pipeline
The current system still relies on the text-based moderation approach where user speech would need to be transcribed to text first, then moderated, then converted back to audio.

The speech-to-speech capability you described would be a significant enhancement that's not yet implemented.
