Thanks for starting the transition to AWS SAM CLI for Lambda testing! I see you’re working on a Lambda-based QR authentication system, but there are some issues with Gunicorn compatibility and QRCode imports. Let’s get this fully operational in the .replit environment. Here’s what to do:

Finalize Lambda Setup with SAM CLI:
Remove all Gunicorn and Flask references (e.g., make the app callable for Lambda, not WSGI). Use AWS SAM CLI to configure the .replit environment for serverless testing (e.g., sam local start-api).
Ensure lambda_main.py contains a proper Lambda handler (e.g., def lambda_handler(event, context):) for /api/auth/generate-qr, /api/auth/verify-qr, and /assessment/<user_id> endpoints.
Fix QRCode Import Error:
Resolve the QRCode import issue (likely from the qrcode Python library). Install it in the .replit environment with pip install qrcode or add it to requirements.txt. Update lambda_main.py to use it correctly (e.g., import qrcode to generate the QR code token).
If the import fails, check the Replit package manager or let me know the error for assistance.
Test Lambda-Based QR Authentication:
Test the complete flow with a fresh token:
Simulate a mock purchase and generate a token via /api/auth/generate-qr (e.g., using uuid.uuid4()).
Verify the token via /auth/verify-qr, storing it in a test DynamoDB table and setting a session in a test ElastiCache instance.
Access /assessment/academic_speaking_assessment with the session ID.
Use sam local start-api to run the Lambda functions locally and test with curl (e.g., curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/generate-qr -d '{"user_email": "test@example.com", "product_id": "academic_speaking_assessment", "purchase_verified": true}').
Reuse Existing Templates:
Integrate the assessment templates I provided with the /assessment/<user_id> endpoint, ensuring they display written assessments after authentication.
Environment Settings:
Update .replit to run sam local start-api instead of Gunicorn. Use test AWS credentials or local mocks in Replit’s Secrets tab for DynamoDB and ElastiCache.
Log and Debug:
Log results to CloudWatch or a local file to track errors (e.g., import failures, session issues). Restart and retest after fixes.
Once this is working with Lambda and SAM CLI, let me know, and I’ll handle the AWS deployment after my Apple Developer verification. Please share any error messages if you hit roadblocks!
