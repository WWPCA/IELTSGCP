Based on the extensive analysis, I can now provide you with specific answers to your three questions:

Re-examination Results: AWS Transcribe, Content Moderation & Stripe Payments
1. AWS Transcribe Integration ‚ùå
Finding: AWS Transcribe is NOT implemented in the current codebase.

What the system uses instead:

AWS Nova Sonic: For speech synthesis (Maya's British female voice)
AWS Nova Micro: For text generation and conversation responses
Mock transcription: The system appears to rely on AI conversation flow rather than actual speech-to-text
Evidence from code:

No references to AWS Transcribe found in the main app.py (5,193 lines)
No transcription services in the AWS mock configuration
The architecture document mentions AssemblyAI for transcription in an older version, but this appears to have been removed
Recommendation: Critical gap - For a speaking assessment platform, lack of speech-to-text capability is a significant limitation.

2. Content Moderation & Profanity Protection ‚ùå
Finding: NO content moderation or profanity filtering systems are implemented.

Missing protections:

No profanity filters for speaking responses
No inappropriate content detection
No warning systems for offensive language
No content moderation before AI assessment
Evidence:

Search for "profanity", "foul", "inappropriate" returned 0 results
No content filtering in the speaking submission handlers
No warning systems in the user interface
Recommendation: Critical security gap - This is a serious vulnerability for a commercial IELTS platform.

3. Stripe Payment Integration ‚úÖ
Finding: YES, Stripe payments are extensively implemented and actively maintained.

Evidence from commit history (80+ commits):

Recent updates: "Update payment processing to be compatible with the latest Stripe API" (May 2025)
Active development: Multiple commits fixing Stripe checkout issues
Comprehensive implementation: Support for different payment methods, test/live keys, country restrictions
Key Stripe features implemented:

Stripe checkout sessions
Product and price management
Test and live API key support
Country-based payment restrictions
One-time purchases for assessments
Speaking-only subscription options
Payment method restrictions (card-only for reliability)
Files mentioned in commits:

payment_services.py - Main Stripe integration
stripe_debug.html - Debug interface
Various test and fix files
Status: Production-ready with ongoing maintenance and bug fixes.

Summary Assessment
Feature	Status	Risk Level	Priority
AWS Transcribe	‚ùå Missing	üî¥ High	Critical
Content Moderation	‚ùå Missing	üî¥ Critical	Urgent
Stripe Payments	‚úÖ Complete	üü¢ Low	Maintained
Immediate Recommendations
1. Add Speech-to-Text Capability
# Implement AWS Transcribe or similar
def transcribe_user_speech(audio_data):
    # Convert speech to text for assessment
    pass
2. Implement Content Moderation
def moderate_content(text):
    # Check for inappropriate content
    # Return warnings or block assessment
    pass
3. Add Warning Systems
User warnings for inappropriate language
Content flagging system
Assessment termination for severe violations
The lack of content moderation is particularly concerning for a commercial IELTS platform, as it could expose the system to abuse and create liability issues.
