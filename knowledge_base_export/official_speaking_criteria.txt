IELTS Speaking Assessment Criteria:

FLUENCY AND COHERENCE (25% of marks):
Band 9: Speaks fluently with only rare repetition or self-correction; any hesitation is content-related rather than to find words or grammar. Speaks coherently with fully appropriate cohesive features. Develops topics fully and appropriately.
Band 8: Speaks fluently with only occasional repetition or self-correction; hesitation is usually content-related and only rarely to search for language. Develops topics coherently and appropriately.
Band 7: Speaks at length without noticeable effort or loss of coherence; may demonstrate language-related hesitation at times, or some repetition and/or self-correction. Uses a range of connectives and discourse markers with some flexibility.
Band 6: Is willing to speak at length, though may lose coherence at times due to occasional repetition, self-correction or hesitation. Uses a range of connectives and discourse markers but not always appropriately.
Band 5: Usually maintains flow of speech but uses repetition, self-correction and/or slow speech to keep going. May over-use certain connectives and discourse markers. Produces simple speech fluently, but more complex communication causes fluency problems.

LEXICAL RESOURCE (25% of marks):
Band 9: Uses vocabulary with full flexibility and precise usage in all topics. Uses idiomatic language naturally and accurately.
Band 8: Uses a wide vocabulary resource readily and flexibly to convey precise meaning. Uses less common and idiomatic vocabulary skilfully, with occasional inaccuracies.
Band 7: Uses vocabulary resource flexibly to discuss a variety of topics. Uses some less common and idiomatic vocabulary and shows some awareness of style and collocation, with some inappropriate choices.
Band 6: Has a wide enough vocabulary to discuss topics at length and make meaning clear in spite of inappropriacies. Generally paraphrases successfully.
Band 5: Manages to talk about familiar and unfamiliar topics but uses vocabulary with limited flexibility. Attempts to use paraphrase but with mixed success.

GRAMMATICAL RANGE AND ACCURACY (25% of marks):
Band 9: Uses a full range of structures naturally and appropriately. Produces consistently accurate structures apart from 'slips' characteristic of native speaker speech.
Band 8: Uses a wide range of structures flexibly. Produces a majority of error-free sentences with only very occasional inappropriacies or basic/non-systematic errors.
Band 7: Uses a range of structures flexibly. Produces a majority of error-free sentences and makes only very occasional errors or inappropriacies.
Band 6: Uses a mix of simple and complex structures, but with limited flexibility. May make frequent mistakes with complex structures, though these rarely cause comprehension problems.
Band 5: Produces basic sentence forms with reasonable accuracy. Uses a limited range of more complex structures, but these usually contain errors and may cause some comprehension problems.

PRONUNCIATION (25% of marks):
Band 9: Uses a full range of pronunciation features with precision and subtlety. Sustains flexible use of features throughout. Is effortless to understand.
Band 8: Uses a wide range of pronunciation features. Sustains flexible use of features, with only occasional lapses. Is easy to understand throughout; L1 accent has minimal effect on intelligibility.
Band 7: Shows all the positive features of Band 6 and some, but not all, of the positive features of Band 8.
Band 6: Uses a range of pronunciation features with mixed control. Shows some effective use of features but this is not sustained. Can generally be understood throughout, though mispronunciation of individual words or sounds reduces clarity at times.
Band 5: Shows all the positive features of Band 4 and some, but not all, of the positive features of Band 6.
