# Mobile Alignment Fix Complete

## Issue Identified
The academic writing assessment sample badge in the mobile view was not properly aligned, causing display issues on mobile devices as shown in the production screenshot.

## Root Cause
The badge container lacked proper Bootstrap flexbox classes for mobile centering, causing the "Academic Writing Assessment Sample" text to appear misaligned on smaller screens.

## Fix Applied

### Template Changes
**File:** `working_template.html`
**Lines:** 321-326

**Before:**
```html
<div class="mb-3">
    <span class="badge bg-light text-dark px-3 py-1" style="font-size: 0.85rem; font-weight: 500;">
        <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt me-1"></i>
        Academic Writing Assessment Sample
    </span>
</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="mb-3 d-flex justify-content-center">
    <span class="badge bg-light text-dark px-3 py-1" style="font-size: 0.85rem; font-weight: 500; display: inline-block; text-align: center;">
        <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt me-1"></i>
        Academic Writing Assessment Sample
    </span>
</div>
```

### CSS Improvements
- **Added `d-flex justify-content-center`**: Ensures proper centering in mobile view
- **Added `display: inline-block`**: Prevents text wrapping issues
- **Added `text-align: center`**: Ensures internal text alignment
