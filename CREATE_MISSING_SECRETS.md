# Missing GitHub Secrets Configuration

Based on your current GitHub secrets, the following secrets are referenced in the workflows but are missing. You need to add these to make the builds work:

## For Android Build (Required for APK Building)

You have: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
Still needed:
1. **`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`** - Your Android keystore file encoded in base64
   ```bash
   # Create a new keystore (if you don't have one):
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore \
     -alias ielts-release -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
   
   # Convert to base64:
   base64 release.keystore > keystore_base64.txt
   # Copy the contents to GitHub secret ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64
   ```

2. **`ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`** - The alias used when creating the keystore (e.g., "ielts-release")

3. **`ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`** - The password for the key within the keystore

## For iOS Build (Required for iOS App Building)

You have: `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
Still needed:
1. **`IOS_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`** - Your Apple Developer certificate (.p12) in base64
2. **`IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`** - Your provisioning profile in base64
3. **`IOS_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY`** - Usually "iPhone Distribution: Your Name"
4. **`IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_NAME`** - Name of your provisioning profile
5. **`IOS_TEAM_ID`** - Your Apple Developer Team ID

## For Google Cloud Integration (Optional - Tests will skip if not present)

Still needed:
1. **`GCP_SA_KEY`** - Google Cloud service account key JSON (only if deploying to GCP)

## Quick Fix Option

If you don't need mobile app builds right now, you can disable those workflows. The main application will still work with the secrets you currently have.
