Overall, total tourist numbers increased significantly over the period, with visitors staying on cruise ships showing more dramatic growth than those staying on the island.

In 2010, approximately 0.75 million tourists stayed on the island, while only about 0.25 million stayed on cruise ships. Both categories showed steady growth until 2015-2016. Island-staying tourists peaked at around 1.5 million in 2013 before fluctuating and ending at approximately 1.5 million in 2017.

In contrast, cruise ship tourists experienced more consistent growth, rising from 0.25 million in 2010 to approximately 2 million by 2017, overtaking island-staying tourists around 2015. By the end of the period, the total number of visitors reached approximately 3.5 million, with cruise ship tourists representing the majority."""

        student_response = """There is ongoing debate about the optimal age for children to start formal education. While some argue for early enrollment, others believe children should wait until after age 7. This essay will discuss both perspectives and provide my opinion.

Proponents of early formal education argue that young children's brains are highly adaptable and can absorb information quickly. Early exposure to structured learning environments can develop cognitive skills and social abilities from a tender age. Additionally, working parents often require childcare, and formal education can provide a productive solution.

However, others contend that children under 7 benefit more from play-based learning rather than formal instruction. Research suggests that premature academic pressure can diminish creativity and cause stress. Countries like Finland, which begin formal schooling at age 7, consistently rank highly in educational outcomes, suggesting that delayed formal education doesn't hinder academic achievement.

In my opinion, a balanced approach is ideal. While very young children may not need rigorous academic instruction, introducing structured learning through play-based methods can be beneficial. Formal education could begin around age 6, allowing children to develop socially and emotionally while gradually transitioning to academic learning.

In conclusion, both early and delayed formal education have merits. A moderate approach that combines play-based learning with gradual academic introduction appears most beneficial for children's holistic development."""

You can experience food and traditions from all over the world without leaving the city. Also, the public transportation system is excellent, which makes it easy to get around.
Maya: Do you think you will continue living there in the future?
