# Stripe Checkout Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed
1. **Price Display Issue**: Fixed the price display problem where $50.00 was showing as $5,000.00 in the checkout page.
2. **Wallet Payment Options**: Enabled Apple Pay and Google Pay payment options through Stripe's automatic payment methods feature.

## Technical Details

### Root Cause of Price Issue
The root cause was inconsistent price handling across different parts of the codebase:
- Assessment products were defined with prices in dollars (25 = $25.00)
- Cart.py was converting them to cents when adding to cart by dividing by 100
- Payment_services.py was then converting again to cents, resulting in 100x inflation

### Technical Changes Made
1. **In cart.py:**
   - Fixed the price handling to store prices in dollars without conversion
   - Corrected the `add_to_cart` function to maintain original price format

2. **In cart_routes.py:**
   - Updated price calculation to convert from dollars to cents for Stripe
   - Enhanced debug logging for better visibility into price calculations
   - Removed hard-coded price value that was previously used for testing

3. **In payment_services.py:**
   - Added automatic payment methods configuration to enable wallet options
   - Verified price conversion to cents is done correctly

## Notes on Wallet Payment Options
- Apple Pay and Google Pay appear automatically when:
  1. The browser/device supports them
  2. The user has set up these payment methods in their device
  3. The Stripe account has them enabled in the dashboard
- These options won't appear in the Replit preview window but will work on real devices
- Make sure your production Stripe account has these payment methods enabled in the dashboard

## Testing Note
When testing checkout, you should see:
1. The correct price displayed ($50.00 for 2 products at $25.00 each)
2. Normal card payment option working
3. Apple Pay/Google Pay options appearing on supported devices/browsers
