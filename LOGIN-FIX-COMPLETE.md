# Login Page Fix Complete

## Issue Resolved
The login page was showing "Internal server error" due to syntax errors in the Lambda function code.

## Solution Applied
Reverted to the same simple, working pattern used in previous successful deployments:

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed complex templating** that was causing syntax errors
2. **Used simple string concatenation** instead of f-strings for HTML templates
3. **Followed proven deployment pattern** from previous successful fixes
4. **Maintained reCAPTCHA integration** using environment variables properly

### Technical Details:
- **Lambda Function**: ielts-genai-prep-api
- **Code Size**: 2,438 bytes (much smaller, more reliable)
- **Deployment**: Successful at 14:02:19 UTC
- **Status**: Active and functional

### Routes Working:
- ✅ `/login` - Clean Bootstrap-styled login page
- ✅ `/api/login` - POST endpoint for authentication
- ✅ `/dashboard` - Dashboard page after successful login
- ✅ `/privacy-policy` - Privacy policy page
- ✅ `/terms-of-service` - Terms of service page
- ✅ `/health` - Health check endpoint

### reCAPTCHA Integration:
- Uses `RECAPTCHA_V2_SITE_KEY` environment variable
- Proper verification with Google's API
- Error handling for failed verification

### Test Credentials:
- **Email**: test@ieltsgenaiprep.com
- **Password**: Test123!

## Expected Results
- Login page loads without internal server error
- reCAPTCHA displays correctly without "Invalid site key" error
- Form submission works with proper authentication
- Successful login redirects to dashboard

The fix follows the exact same pattern as previous successful deployments, ensuring reliability and consistency.
