Scores and feedback provided on this platform have no official standing and will not be recognized by any institution, immigration authority, or educational body.</p>
                
                <h3>1.3 No Predictive Guarantee</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>AI assessment technology has inherent limitations and may interpret responses differently than human examiners</li>

                    <li>AI scoring rubrics, while based on IELTS criteria, are approximations and may not precisely replicate human examiner judgment</li>
                    <li>Subjective elements of language assessment (such as coherence, lexical sophistication, and communicative effectiveness) are particularly challenging for AI to evaluate</li>
