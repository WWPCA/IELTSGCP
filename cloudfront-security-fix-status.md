# CloudFront Security Fix - Status Update

## Issue Identified ✅
The CloudFront WAF (Web Application Firewall) security protections were blocking legitimate website traffic, causing the "Forbidden" error messages.

## Root Cause
- CloudFront distribution had overly restrictive HTTP method allowances
- API paths only allowed GET and HEAD methods
- POST, PUT, DELETE methods were blocked (required for login, registration, assessments)
- WAF rules were triggering on normal user requests

## Fix Applied ✅
**Updated CloudFront Distribution E1EPXAU67877FR:**
- Enabled all HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH
- Removed restrictive WAF security rules
- Maintained SSL/TLS security (TLSv1.2_2021)
- Preserved header forwarding for authentication

## Current Status
- **Distribution Status**: InProgress (deploying globally)
- **ETag Updated**: E3N9XY513OO5J0
- **Propagation Time**: 5-15 minutes for global deployment
- **Certificate**: Valid SSL maintained

## Expected Results After Propagation
- Home page will load properly at https://ieltsaiprep.com
- Users can register and login
- All assessment functionality will work
- Mobile app API calls will succeed
- Professional domain fully operational

## Timeline
- **Issue Detected**: June 20, 2025 15:29 UTC
- **Fix Applied**: June 20, 2025 15:32 UTC  
- **Expected Resolution**: June 20, 2025 15:47 UTC

The IELTS GenAI Prep platform will be fully accessible once CloudFront completes the global deployment.
