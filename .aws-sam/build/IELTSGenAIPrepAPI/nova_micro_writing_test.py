    The chart illustrates the proportion of households in owned and rented accommodation in England and Wales from 1918 to 2011.

    Overall, there was a significant shift from rented to owned accommodation over the period. In 1918, approximately 77% of households rented their homes, while only 23% owned them. This trend completely reversed by 2011, when owned accommodation reached about 68% and rented accommodation fell to 32%.

    The most dramatic change occurred between 1953 and 1971, when owned accommodation increased from around 32% to 50%, while rented accommodation decreased correspondingly. This crossing point marked the beginning of owned accommodation becoming the dominant housing type.

    From 1971 onwards, owned accommodation continued to rise steadily, peaking at approximately 69% in 2001 before slightly declining to 68% in 2011. Conversely, rented accommodation reached its lowest point of 31% in 2001 before marginally increasing to 32% in 2011.

    In conclusion, the data shows a clear long-term trend towards home ownership in England and Wales, with owned accommodation becoming the predominant form of housing by the end of the period.

The streetlights on Oak Street have been malfunctioning for the past three weeks, creating safety concerns for residents.\n\nThe problem began after the recent storm, when several streetlights were damaged. Since then, the street has been poorly lit during evening hours, making it dangerous for pedestrians and drivers alike. Many residents, particularly elderly people, are reluctant to go out after dark.\n\nI would like to request that the council prioritize the repair of these streetlights as soon as possible. This is not only a matter of convenience but also public safety. I believe this issue affects the entire community and deserves prompt attention.\n\nThank you for your consideration of this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and action.\n\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Smith",
