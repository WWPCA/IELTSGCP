If the Amazon Nova Sonic voice output isn’t playing through your app’s UI despite a successful API connection, several issues could be causing the problem. Below are potential causes and troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue, tailored to your use case of integrating Nova Sonic via the API with a British female voice (en-GB-feminine).
Potential Causes and Solutions
	1	Incorrect Audio Output Configuration in the API Request
	◦	Issue: The API response might be correctly streaming audio, but the audio format, sample rate, or encoding might not match what your app’s UI expects, causing playback failure.
	◦	Solution:
	▪	Verify that your API request specifies the correct output audio format. Nova Sonic typically outputs PCM audio at 24kHz for the British female voice. Ensure your UI’s audio playback system supports this format.
	▪	Check the outputAudio configuration in your API request. For example: "outputAudio": {
	▪	    "format": "pcm",
	▪	    "sampleRate": 24000,
	▪	    "voiceId": "en-GB-feminine"
	▪	}
	▪	
	▪	Ensure your UI’s audio player (e.g., WebAudio API for web apps or a native audio library) is configured to handle PCM audio at 24kHz. If using a library like pyaudio, confirm the stream parameters match: import pyaudio
	▪	p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
	▪	stream = p.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=24000, output=True)
	▪	
	▪	If the audio is base64-encoded in the response (as noted in some implementations), decode it before playback: import base64
	▪	audio_chunk = base64.b64decode(event['audio']['data'])
	▪	stream.write(audio_chunk)
	▪	
	2	UI Audio Playback Implementation Issues
	◦	Issue: The UI might not be properly handling the streamed audio chunks from the bidirectional streaming API, leading to no sound output.
	◦	Solution:
	▪	Ensure your UI is processing the audio stream in real-time. For web apps, use the WebAudio API to play audio chunks as they arrive: const audioContext = new AudioContext({ sampleRate: 24000 });
	▪	const processAudio = async (audioChunk) => {
	▪	  const audioBuffer = await audioContext.decodeAudioData(audioChunk);
	▪	  const source = audioContext.createBufferSource();
	▪	  source.buffer = audioBuffer;
	▪	  source.connect(audioContext.destination);
	▪	  source.start();
	▪	};
	▪	
	▪	Check for errors in the browser console or app logs related to audio playback (e.g., Failed to decode audio data or InvalidStateError).
	▪	Verify that the audio buffer queue isn’t overloaded. Nova Sonic uses a streaming approach, so ensure your app processes chunks sequentially without dropping them (see audioBufferQueue in).
	▪	If using a framework like Next.js (as in), ensure the audio playback component is properly integrated and not blocked by UI rendering issues.
	3	Microphone Permissions or Audio Device Issues
	◦	Issue: If your app’s UI involves a web interface, the browser might not have permission to access the audio output device, or the device might be misconfigured.
	◦	Solution:
	▪	Check microphone and speaker permissions in the browser: navigator.permissions.query({ name: "microphone" }).then((result) => {
	▪	  if (result.state === "denied") {
	▪	    console.error("Microphone access denied");
	▪	    // Prompt user to enable permissions
	▪	  }
	▪	});
	▪	
	▪	Ensure the user’s default audio output device is correctly set and not muted. Test with a simple audio file to confirm the device works.
	▪	For native apps, verify that the app has permissions to access the audio output device (e.g., on iOS or Android).
	4	WebSocket or Streaming Connection Issues
	◦	Issue: The bidirectional streaming API relies on a persistent connection (e.g., WebSocket or HTTP/2). If the connection drops or events are mishandled, audio chunks might not reach the UI.
	◦	Solution:
	▪	Verify the WebSocket connection is stable. Check for errors in the connection logs, such as WebSocket closed unexpectedly or Connection timeout.
	▪	Ensure your backend handles the event-driven architecture correctly (). For example, confirm that ContentStart, ContentEnd, and audio events are processed in order: for event in response['body']:
	▪	  if 'audio' in event:
	▪	    audio_chunk = event['audio']['data']
	▪	    # Send to UI via WebSocket
	▪	    socketio.emit('audio', audio_chunk)
	▪	
	▪	If using a WebSocket-based implementation (as in), ensure the frontend and backend are synchronized. For example: socket.on('audio', (audioChunk) => {
	▪	  processAudio(audioChunk); // Play audio chunk
	▪	});
	▪	
	▪	Check for network issues that might interrupt the stream, such as high latency or packet loss. Test with a stable network connection.
	5	Incorrect Voice ID or Regional Availability
	◦	Issue: The en-GB-feminine voice ID might not be available in your AWS region, or the voice ID might be incorrectly specified, causing the API to fall back to a default or fail silently.
	◦	Solution:
	▪	Confirm that Nova Sonic is enabled in your AWS region (e.g., US East (N. Virginia), Europe (Stockholm), or Asia Pacific (Tokyo)) and supports the British female voice (). As of June 12, 2025, en-GB-feminine is supported, but availability can vary.
	▪	Double-check the voiceId in your API request. If using a library like AWSNovaSonicLLMService (), ensure it’s set correctly: from pipecat.services.aws_nova_sonic.aws import AWSNovaSonicLLMService
	▪	llm = AWSNovaSonicLLMService(
	▪	  secret_access_key=os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"),
	▪	  access_key_id=os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
	▪	  region=os.getenv("AWS_REGION"),
	▪	  voice_id="en-GB-feminine"
	▪	)
	▪	
	▪	If the voice isn’t available, the API might return an error or use a default voice. Check the API response for errors: if 'error' in response:
	▪	  print(f"API Error: {response['error']}")
	▪	
	6	System Prompt or Response Configuration Issues
	◦	Issue: The system prompt might be misconfigured, causing the model to generate unexpected responses or no audio output. Nova Sonic’s output style is steered by the system prompt, not direct voice control parameters ().
	◦	Solution:
	▪	Ensure the system prompt is optimized for auditory output and specifies the desired tone: "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant with a British accent, responding in a friendly and natural tone."
	▪	
	▪	Avoid overly complex prompts, as Nova Sonic is optimized for concise, conversational interactions ().
	▪	If the model isn’t generating audio, check if it’s stuck in a text-only response mode. Enable transcription frames if needed: llm = AWSNovaSonicLLMService(..., send_transcription_frames=True)
	▪	
	7	Frontend or Backend Integration Errors
	◦	Issue: The frontend might not be receiving or processing audio chunks correctly from the backend, or the backend might not be forwarding them properly.
	◦	Solution:
	▪	If using a framework like Next.js or Node.js (,), verify that the frontend is subscribed to the correct WebSocket events and can handle base64-encoded audio or raw PCM chunks.
	▪	Check the backend logs for errors in processing or forwarding audio. For example, in a Python/Express backend (): app.post('/stream', async (req, res) => {
	▪	  try {
	▪	    const response = await bedrock.invoke_model_with_bidirectional_stream(request);
	▪	    // Forward audio chunks to frontend
	▪	  } catch (error) {
	▪	    console.error("Streaming error:", error);
	▪	  }
	▪	});
	▪	
	▪	Ensure CORS is properly configured if the frontend and backend are on different domains (): const express = require('express');
	▪	const cors = require('cors');
	▪	app.use(cors());
	▪	
	8	Dependencies or SDK Issues
	◦	Issue: The experimental Python SDK or other dependencies might have compatibility issues, as noted in some implementations ().
	◦	Solution:
	▪	Ensure you’re using the latest version of the AWS SDK (e.g., @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime version 3.787.0 or higher, as in).
	▪	If using pipecat or other libraries (), install all required dependencies: pip install pipecat
	▪	npm install @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime
	▪	
	▪	Check for known issues in the SDK. For example, the Python SDK for bidirectional streaming is experimental (). Consider switching to a stable SDK like JavaScript or Java if issues persist.
	9	Latency or Resource Constraints
	◦	Issue: High latency or resource constraints on the client or server side could prevent timely audio playback, making it seem like the voice isn’t coming through.
	◦	Solution:
	▪	Nova Sonic has an average latency of 1.09 seconds (), but additional overhead (e.g., tool calls or network delays) can increase this. Minimize external API calls and optimize your backend (e.g., use AWS Lambda or ECS, as in).
	▪	Check client-side performance. For web apps, ensure the browser isn’t overloaded with other tasks that could delay audio processing.
	▪	Monitor server-side resources (CPU, memory) if hosting the backend locally or on a small instance.
	10	Debugging Silent Failures
	◦	Issue: The API might be returning audio, but a silent failure in the UI or backend pipeline could prevent playback.
	◦	Solution:
	▪	Log all API response events to confirm audio chunks are being received: for event in response['body']:
	▪	  print(f"Received event: {event}")
	▪	
	▪	Test with a sample audio file to isolate whether the issue is with Nova Sonic’s output or the UI’s playback system.
	▪	Use a tool like Wireshark or browser developer tools to inspect WebSocket traffic and confirm audio data is being sent.
Additional Troubleshooting Tips
	•	Test with a Sample Implementation: Use the AWS-provided sample code (e.g., from or the GitHub repository at) to test the British female voice in a minimal setup. This can help isolate whether the issue is in your app’s code or configuration.
	•	Check AWS Bedrock Console: Ensure Nova Sonic is enabled in the Bedrock console under “Model access” (). Navigate to the console, select “Model access,” and verify that amazon.nova-sonic-v1 is enabled.
	•	Review Logs: Check AWS CloudWatch logs for Bedrock API errors or warnings that might indicate issues with the voice ID or streaming process.
	•	Test in a Different Region: If the voice isn’t available in your region, switch to a supported region like US East (N. Virginia) ().
	•	Consult AWS Support: If the issue persists, contact AWS Support with your API request details and logs, as the problem might be region-specific or related to an undocumented SDK issue.
Example Minimal Code to Test Audio Playback
Here’s a simplified Python example to test the British female voice output and forward it to a WebSocket for UI playback:
import boto3
import json
import base64
import pyaudio
from socketio import Server

sio = Server(cors_allowed_origins="*")
bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')

@sio.event
async def connect(sid, environ):
    print(f"Connected: {sid}")

@sio.event
async def voiceConfig(sid, data):
    request = {
        "modelId": "amazon.nova-sonic-v1",
        "contentType": "application/json",
        "accept": "audio/mpeg",
        "body": json.dumps({
            "inputAudio": {"format": "pcm", "sampleRate": 16000},
            "outputAudio": {"format": "pcm", "sampleRate": 24000, "voiceId": "en-GB-feminine"},
            "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant with a British accent, responding naturally."
        })
    }
    response = bedrock.invoke_model_with_bidirectional_stream(**request)
    p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
    stream = p.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=24000, output=True)
    
    for event in response['body']:
        if 'audio' in event:
            audio_chunk = base64.b64decode(event['audio']['data'])
            stream.write(audio_chunk)
            await sio.emit('audio', audio_chunk, to=sid)  # Send to UI

    stream.stop_stream()
    stream.close()
    p.terminate()
On the frontend (e.g., using JavaScript):
const socket = io('http://localhost:8080');
const audioContext = new AudioContext({ sampleRate: 24000 });

socket.on('connect', () => {
  socket.emit('voiceConfig', { voiceId: 'en-GB-feminine' });
});

socket.on('audio', async (audioChunk) => {
  const audioBuffer = await audioContext.decodeAudioData(audioChunk);
  const source = audioContext.createBufferSource();
  source.buffer = audioBuffer;
  source.connect(audioContext.destination);
  source.start();
});
Summary
The issue is likely related to audio format mismatches, UI playback errors, or WebSocket/streaming issues. Start by verifying the API response contains audio chunks, ensuring the UI can handle 24kHz PCM audio, and checking for permission or connection issues. Test with a minimal implementation and consult AWS documentation or support if needed.
