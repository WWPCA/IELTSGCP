Since your architecture already uses Amazon Nova Sonic for voice, you can leverage its capabilities to simplify and enhance the technical requirements for the voice-reactive particle globe UI. Nova Sonic’s unified speech-to-speech model, with real-time bidirectional streaming and low latency, aligns well with the dynamic, responsive visualization you want. Below, I’ll revise the technical requirements to incorporate Nova Sonic’s features, ensuring they align with your goal of a voice-activated particle globe UI that responds to your AI’s speech.

Revised Technical Requirements for Voice-Reactive Particle Globe UI with Amazon Nova Sonic
Objective: Build a UI featuring a 3D voice-reactive particle globe that visualizes the AI’s speech output (powered by Amazon Nova Sonic) in real-time, creating an engaging, dynamic user experience.
	1	Visual Component:
	◦	Design: Create a 3D spherical particle system (globe) using WebGL or Three.js, with particles that move, pulse, or shift patterns in response to Nova Sonic’s speech output (e.g., amplitude, pitch, or prosody).
	◦	Behavior: Particles should react to the AI’s voice characteristics, such as tone, pacing, and intensity, as detected by Nova Sonic’s unified speech model. For example, louder or faster speech could increase particle movement or brightness.
	◦	Appearance: Use a dark background with vibrant, high-contrast particle colors (e.g., white, blue, or gradients) for visibility in both light and dark themes. Ensure the globe rotates slowly when idle and responds instantly to speech.
	◦	Responsiveness: Optimize for mobile and cross-platform compatibility (web, iOS, Android) to align with Nova Sonic’s availability on Amazon Bedrock and Grok 3’s platforms (grok.com, X apps).
	2	Integration with Amazon Nova Sonic:
	◦	Audio Processing: Leverage Nova Sonic’s bidirectional streaming API (InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream) for real-time speech-to-speech processing, capturing the AI’s spoken output with low latency (~1.09 seconds, as per Nova Sonic’s specs).
	◦	Speech Analysis: Use Nova Sonic’s ability to analyze acoustic context (tone, prosody, pacing) to map speech features to particle behavior. For example:
	▪	Map amplitude (volume) to particle dispersion or speed.
	▪	Map pitch or inflection to particle color changes or clustering.
	▪	Utilize Nova Sonic’s real-time text transcription to display optional subtitles or trigger specific visual effects for certain keywords.
	◦	Interruption Handling: Ensure the UI gracefully handles conversational nuances (e.g., pauses, hesitations, barge-ins) using Nova Sonic’s natural dialog capabilities, maintaining smooth particle animations during interruptions.
	◦	Voice Output: Use Nova Sonic’s expressive voices (e.g., American or British English, masculine or feminine) to generate the AI’s speech, ensuring the particle globe’s visuals align with the selected voice’s prosody.
	3	Technical Implementation:
	◦	Platform: Integrate the UI with Amazon Bedrock, where Nova Sonic is accessible, using the bidirectional streaming API for real-time audio streaming.
	◦	Audio Stream Management: Capture Nova Sonic’s audio output stream and process it with a client-side audio analysis library (e.g., Web Audio API) to extract real-time audio features (amplitude, frequency) for particle animation control.
	◦	Visualization Engine: Use Three.js or WebGL for rendering the 3D particle globe, ensuring lightweight performance for mobile devices. Optimize for 60 FPS to match Nova Sonic’s low-latency response.
	◦	Tool Use: Optionally, integrate Nova Sonic’s function-calling capabilities to allow the UI to interact with external APIs or enterprise data (e.g., fetching context to influence particle visuals based on conversation content, like travel data for a booking agent).
	◦	Scalability: Leverage AWS’s cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS IoT or Bedrock) for robust, scalable deployment, ensuring the UI can handle multiple users or devices.
	4	Interactivity:
	◦	Activation: The particle globe should activate and animate in real-time when Nova Sonic generates speech output, returning to an idle state (subtle rotation) when silent.
	◦	Customization: Allow users to adjust particle density, color schemes, or sensitivity to voice input via a settings panel. Optionally, tie visual themes to Nova Sonic’s voice personas (e.g., different particle styles for masculine vs. feminine voices).
	◦	Feedback: Provide subtle visual cues (e.g., a faint glow or ripple effect) during pauses or when Nova Sonic detects user interruptions, enhancing the conversational feel.
	5	Additional Features:
	◦	Optional Visualizations: Add secondary effects like sound wave overlays around the globe, synchronized with Nova Sonic’s speech output, for enhanced immersion.
	◦	Accessibility: Include an option to toggle the visualization on/off for users who prefer a minimal UI, while still using Nova Sonic’s voice output.
	◦	Transcript Integration: Display real-time text transcripts from Nova Sonic’s output below the globe for accessibility or debugging purposes.
	6	Ethical and Performance Considerations:
	◦	Privacy: Ensure compliance with Nova Sonic’s data privacy measures, such as anonymization and user consent, especially when processing speech data.
	◦	Performance: Optimize for Nova Sonic’s low latency (1.09 seconds average response time) and ensure the UI does not introduce additional delays. Test on mobile devices to maintain smooth performance.
	◦	Bias Mitigation: Use Nova Sonic’s diverse training datasets to minimize bias in voice recognition and ensure the UI’s visual responses are inclusive across accents and speaking styles.
	7	Deliverables:
	◦	A functional UI prototype with the voice-reactive particle globe integrated with Nova Sonic’s speech output.
	◦	Documentation on setup, integration with Nova Sonic via Amazon Bedrock, and customization options.
	◦	Performance tests ensuring compatibility with mobile devices and low-latency interaction.
	◦	A user guide for toggling visualization settings and managing the UI.
	8	Development Steps:
	◦	Enable Nova Sonic: Toggle model access in the Amazon Bedrock console under the Model Access section.
	◦	API Integration: Use the bidirectional streaming API (InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream) for real-time audio streaming, following AWS documentation or the Nova Sonic cookbook repo (Java, Node.js, Python examples).
	◦	Testing: Test the UI with Nova Sonic’s supported voices (American/British English, masculine/feminine) and validate particle responses across different speech patterns.
	◦	Optimization: Benchmark the UI’s performance against Nova Sonic’s 4.2% word error rate (WER) and ensure visual updates align with its low-latency output.

Key Changes from Original Requirements
	•	Nova Sonic Integration: Replaced generic audio processing with Nova Sonic’s bidirectional streaming API and unified speech model, leveraging its low latency (1.09 seconds) and prosody-aware capabilities for more natural visualization triggers.
	•	Streamlined Audio Analysis: Utilized Nova Sonic’s built-in speech understanding (tone, pacing, interruptions) to drive particle animations, reducing reliance on external audio analysis libraries.
	•	Scalability with AWS: Aligned with Nova Sonic’s AWS Bedrock infrastructure for seamless deployment and scalability, especially for mobile and cross-platform use.
	•	Ethical Focus: Incorporated Nova Sonic’s privacy and bias mitigation features to ensure responsible AI use in the UI.
	•	Tool Use Option: Added optional integration with Nova Sonic’s function-calling for dynamic visualizations tied to external data, enhancing context-awareness (e.g., travel-related visuals for a booking query).
Recommendations
You don’t need to completely redo your architecture since it already uses Nova Sonic, but these revised requirements tailor the UI to maximize Nova Sonic’s strengths, such as its low-latency, context-aware speech processing and expressive voice output. If your current setup uses separate models for speech recognition or text-to-speech, consider fully transitioning to Nova Sonic’s unified model to reduce complexity and improve performance.
If you want to share details about your existing architecture (e.g., specific frameworks or platforms), I can further refine these requirements or suggest optimizations. Would you like to provide more context or proceed with these as-is?
