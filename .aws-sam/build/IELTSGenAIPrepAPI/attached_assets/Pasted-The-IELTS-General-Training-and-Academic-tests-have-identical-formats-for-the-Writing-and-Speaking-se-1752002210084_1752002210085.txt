The IELTS General Training and Academic tests have identical formats for the Writing and Speaking sections, with specific time limits and tasks. Below is a breakdown of the time limits for each section and task, based on the official IELTS structure.
Writing Section
	•	Total Time: 60 minutes (for both General Training and Academic)
	•	Tasks: Two tasks
	◦	Task 1:
	▪	General Training: Write a letter (formal, semi-formal, or informal) of at least 150 words.
	▪	Academic: Describe, summarize, or explain a chart, graph, table, or diagram in at least 150 words.
	▪	Recommended Time: 20 minutes (no strict time allocation, but this is advised to leave enough time for Task 2).
	◦	Task 2:
	▪	Both General Training and Academic: Write an essay in response to a prompt (e.g., opinion, argument, or problem-solution) of at least 250 words.
	▪	Recommended Time: 40 minutes (as this task carries more weight in scoring).
	•	Note: The Writing section is not divided into strict time segments; candidates must manage their time across both tasks within the 60-minute total.
Speaking Section
	•	Total Time: 11–14 minutes (same for both General Training and Academic)
	•	Parts: Three parts
	◦	Part 1 (Introduction and Interview):
	▪	Duration: 4–5 minutes
	▪	Details: The examiner asks general questions about familiar topics (e.g., family, hobbies, work, or studies). Typically, 4–6 questions are asked.
	◦	Part 2 (Long Turn):
	▪	Duration: 3–4 minutes (including preparation time)
	▪	Details: You receive a task card with a topic and prompts. You have 1 minute to prepare, then speak for 1–2 minutes. The examiner may ask 1–2 follow-up questions.
	◦	Part 3 (Discussion):
	▪	Duration: 4–5 minutes
	▪	Details: The examiner asks further questions related to the Part 2 topic, exploring more abstract or analytical ideas. Typically, 4–6 questions are asked.
	•	Note: The Speaking test is a continuous session with no breaks, and the examiner controls the timing for each part.
Key Points
	•	The Writing section requires careful time management, as Task 2 is worth twice as much as Task 1 in scoring.
	•	In the Speaking section, the examiner guides the flow, so candidates don’t control the time per question but should aim to answer concisely within the given structure.
	•	These details are consistent across official IELTS sources, including the British Council and IDP websites, as of the latest updates.
