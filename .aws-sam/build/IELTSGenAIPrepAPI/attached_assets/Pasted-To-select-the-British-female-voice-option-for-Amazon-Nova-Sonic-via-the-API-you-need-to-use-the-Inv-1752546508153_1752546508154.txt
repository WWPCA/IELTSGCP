To select the British female voice option for Amazon Nova Sonic via the API, you need to use the InvokeModelWithBidirectionalStream API in Amazon Bedrock and specify the appropriate voice ID for the British English feminine-sounding voice. Here’s how to do it:
	1	Set Up the AWS SDK: Ensure you have the AWS SDK installed (e.g., boto3 for Python) and configured with your credentials.
	2	Initialize the Bedrock Client: Create a client for Amazon Bedrock to interact with Nova Sonic. import boto3
	3	
	4	bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')
	5	
	6	Specify the Voice ID: For Nova Sonic, the voice ID for the British English feminine-sounding voice is typically en-GB-feminine (based on available documentation). Confirm the exact ID in the Amazon Nova Sonic User Guide or AWS Bedrock console, as voice IDs may vary.
	7	Configure the API Request: Use the bidirectional streaming API and include the voice configuration in the request payload. Set the voiceId to en-GB-feminine and ensure the language is set to en-GB. import json
	8	
	9	# Example configuration for the streaming API
	10	request = {
	11	    "modelId": "amazon.nova-sonic-v1",
	12	    "contentType": "application/json",
	13	    "accept": "audio/mpeg",
	14	    "body": json.dumps({
	15	        "inputAudio": {
	16	            "format": "pcm",
	17	            "sampleRate": 16000
	18	        },
	19	        "outputAudio": {
	20	            "format": "pcm",
	21	            "sampleRate": 24000,
	22	            "voiceId": "en-GB-feminine"  # British female voice
	23	        },
	24	        "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant with a British accent, responding in a friendly and natural tone."
	25	    })
	26	}
	27	
	28	Stream the Audio: Use the invoke_model_with_bidirectional_stream method to send audio input and receive the response in the British female voice. Handle the streaming events as shown in the Python example below: response = bedrock.invoke_model_with_bidirectional_stream(**request)
	29	
	30	# Process the streaming response
	31	for event in response['body']:
	32	    if 'audio' in event:
	33	        # Handle the audio output (e.g., play or save the stream)
	34	        audio_chunk = event['audio']['data']
	35	        # Add code to process audio_chunk (e.g., play using pyaudio)
	36	
	37	Key Notes:
	◦	Voice Availability: As of June 12, 2025, Nova Sonic supports a feminine-sounding voice in British English, among other options. Verify the exact voiceId in the AWS documentation or Bedrock console, as it may be updated.
	◦	Dependencies: Ensure you have the experimental Python SDK for bidirectional streaming or use other supported SDKs (e.g., Java, JavaScript).
	◦	Audio Settings: Input audio should be PCM at 16kHz, and output can be configured for 24kHz PCM for the British female voice.
	◦	Permissions: Ensure your AWS IAM role has access to invoke the Nova Sonic model in Bedrock.
	◦	Error Handling: Check for errors in the response stream and validate the voice ID if the output doesn’t match expectations.
For detailed guidance, refer to the Amazon Nova Sonic User Guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com or the API documentation at https://x.ai/api. If the British female voice isn’t available in your region, contact your AWS representative to confirm availability or future updates.
