# Production 404 Fixes Complete

## Issues Identified
Multiple production pages were returning 404 errors:
1. **Login page**: www.ieltsaiprep.com/login
2. **Privacy Policy page**: www.ieltsaiprep.com/privacy-policy  
3. **Terms of Service page**: www.ieltsaiprep.com/terms-of-service
4. **Mobile alignment issue**: Academic writing sample badge misaligned on mobile devices

## Root Cause Analysis
The production AWS Lambda function was missing complete route handling for these pages. The local development environment had all routes working, but the production deployment lacked:
