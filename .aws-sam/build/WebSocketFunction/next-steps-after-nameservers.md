# Next Steps After Adding Nameservers to Namecheap

## What You Just Did
Added these Route 53 nameservers to Namecheap Custom DNS:
- ns-22.awsdns-02.com
- ns-1255.awsdns-28.org  
- ns-1995.awsdns-57.co.uk
- ns-763.awsdns-31.net

## Timeline
- **DNS Propagation**: 15 minutes - 2 hours (usually within 30 minutes)
- **SSL Certificate Validation**: 5-30 minutes after DNS propagation
- **Total Time**: Usually 45 minutes, maximum 2.5 hours

## Check Progress
Run this command to check SSL certificate status:
```bash
./check-certificate-status.sh
```

## What Happens Next (Automatic)
1. DNS propagates worldwide
2. AWS validates the SSL certificate automatically
3. Certificate status changes from PENDING_VALIDATION ‚Üí ISSUED
4. Create API Gateway custom domain mapping
5. Update mobile app configuration with ieltsaiprep.com URLs
6. Test complete professional domain setup

## Current Status
‚úÖ Route 53 hosted zone created
‚úÖ SSL certificate requested  
‚úÖ DNS validation records added to Route 53
‚úÖ Nameservers provided to Namecheap
üîÑ **WAITING**: DNS propagation and certificate validation
‚è≥ **NEXT**: API Gateway custom domain creation

## Mobile App Ready
All mobile app configurations are prepared with ieltsaiprep.com URLs. Once certificate validates, the app will use the professional domain instead of AWS Lambda URLs.
