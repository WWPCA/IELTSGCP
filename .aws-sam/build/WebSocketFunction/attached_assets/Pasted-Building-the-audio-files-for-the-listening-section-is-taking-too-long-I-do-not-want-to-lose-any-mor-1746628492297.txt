Building the audio files for the listening section is taking too long. I do not want to lose any more time to launch. Pivot our strategy to launch version 1 of the app with just 4 products - 

Product 1: Academic Writing assessment with AI: 
This product will include Academic Writing questions that exist in the database grouped in two categories shown below. Re-use the questions we have in our database to create 4 sets of task 1 and task 2. Four sets create one product. Within that product, each set should be packaged as one complete academic writing assessment set:
Task 1 (Charts/Graphs): Visual data interpretation tasks with bar charts, line graphs
Task 2 (Essays): Essay topics on global economy, education, environment, technology

Product 2: Academic Speaking assessment with AI: 
This product will include Academic Speaking assessment prompts that exist in the database grouped in three parts shown below. Re-use the prompts we have in our database to create 4 sets of Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3. Four sets create one product. Within that product, each set should be packaged as one complete Academic Speaking assessment set. The user should also be prompted to first listen to the prompt, and then press the record button to record their response for AI to assess. AI should then share the assessment in writing. The user should be able to view the prompt and their response in the assessment. The assessment should be permanently saved in the user profile.

Then, while saving and retaining ALL test questions in our database, please replace the three full length tests from the "Choose Your IELTS Preparation Plan" on the home page and replace it with the four products above. Each product will allow the user to use each assessment set ONLY one time. The AI assessment saved on their account is available until the user deletes their account. The user will continue to have access to their account even after they have used all their products. Test Day guide is provided with all products. The user should only be able to access the assessments within the product they purchased. All other products should be visible to purchase or re-purchase from within their user account. Each product is priced at USD 25.
