updated the architecture for the IELTS GenAI Prep Application to make it scalable globally and integrate with app store payments. Here’s what’s changed and what you need to update to work with this new setup:

Architectural Updates:
We’re now using AWS Lambda to run the Flask backend, which will automatically scale to handle millions of users worldwide.
The database has switched from PostgreSQL to DynamoDB global tables, spread across multiple regions (like us-east-1, eu-west-1, and ap-southeast-1) for fast access everywhere.
We’re using ElastiCache with Redis clusters in multiple regions to cache sessions and user progress, improving speed and reliability.
CloudWatch is set up to monitor everything and trigger auto-scaling when needed.
Payments are now handled through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store (at $36 per assessment module), so we’re dropping web-based payments.
The app uses API Gateway with Route 53 to route users to the nearest region for low latency.
What You Need to Update:
Switch to Regional API Calls:
Stop using the old Flask URL and start calling regional API Gateway endpoints (e.g., https://<regional-endpoint>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<stage>). Use Route 53 to figure out the nearest region based on where the user is and route the request there.</stage></region></regional-endpoint>
Update Database Access:
Replace all PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy calls with DynamoDB API calls using the AWS SDK (Boto3). For example, save a user’s score with dynamodb.Table('IELTSUsers').put_item(Item={'user_id': '123', 'score': 85}). Make sure it works with DynamoDB global tables across regions.
Set Up ElastiCache:
Connect to ElastiCache Redis clusters (e.g., my-cache-cluster.abcd1234.0001.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com) to store sessions and progress. Use a Redis client like redis-py to save data, like redis_client.set('session:123', 'data', ex=3600) for a 1-hour session. Sync this with DynamoDB when the app is online.
Handle App Store Payments:
Remove all web payment code. Instead, add support for in-app purchases:
For Apple, use the App Store Connect API to verify receipts with /verifyReceipt.
For Google, use the Play Billing API to check purchases with purchases.products.get.
After verifying a purchase, unlock the assessment module and save the status in DynamoDB.
Support Offline Use:
Let users start assessments offline. Cache their progress locally or in ElastiCache, and add a sync_offline_progress(user_id) function to update DynamoDB when they’re back online.
Update Environment Settings:
In Replit’s Secrets tab, add AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) and set AWS_REGION to a default like us-east-1, but let the code pick the best region. Add API Gateway URLs for each region and app store keys (Apple Shared Secret, Google Service Account JSON).
Add Retry Logic:
Include retry attempts (with exponential backoff) for API calls to handle Lambda cold starts or scaling delays, using the AWS SDK’s built-in retry features.
Test Everything:
Use Replit’s live reload to test API calls across regions and simulate in-app purchases. Send logs to CloudWatch to check for errors or delays.
How to Do It:
Rewrite the Flask app to work with Lambda, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache. Update all API routes to use the new endpoints.
