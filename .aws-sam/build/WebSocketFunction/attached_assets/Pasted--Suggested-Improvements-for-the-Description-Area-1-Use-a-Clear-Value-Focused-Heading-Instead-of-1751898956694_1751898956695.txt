🔧 Suggested Improvements for the Description Area:
1. Use a Clear, Value-Focused Heading
Instead of just:

Sample IELTS Score Report

Use something like:

See Exactly How Your IELTS Score Will Look
Instant feedback. Official IELTS alignment. No guesswork.

This turns the focus from “example” to user benefit — it creates a desire to experience their own version.

2. Break Down Each Score With Context
Under each skill score (Writing, Speaking, etc.), add 1-line of explanation:

✅ Academic Writing: 8.0

Clear structure, well-supported ideas, minimal grammar issues.

✅ Academic Speaking: 7.0

Fluent delivery with minor hesitation and natural vocabulary.

This shows what users will learn from their score — not just the number.

3. Highlight Credibility More Boldly
This line:

GenAI-Assessed with Official IELTS Criteria

Could be reworded to:

✅ Powered by Official IELTS Marking Rubrics + GenAI Precision

And consider adding trust symbols (✓ Official Rubrics, 🔍 AI Feedback, 🏆 Trusted by Thousands)

4. Mini Comparison or Tooltip Option
Let users compare AI vs Human scoring (if applicable):

“Our GenAI results are benchmarked against certified IELTS examiner grading — 96% alignment.”

Even adding a little info icon (ℹ️) to explain how the band score is generated adds transparency.

5. Make It Interactive (Optional Enhancement)
You could let users hover/click to see how feedback might appear for a sample task:

📝 Task 2 Writing Feedback:
"Your argument is clearly presented and well-organized. Consider developing your examples further for an even stronger response."
