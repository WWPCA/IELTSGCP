Architectural Updates:
We’re now using AWS Lambda to run the backend, which will automatically scale to handle millions of users worldwide.
The database has switched from PostgreSQL to DynamoDB global tables, spread across multiple regions (like us-east-1, eu-west-1, and ap-southeast-1) for fast access everywhere.
We’re using ElastiCache with Redis clusters in multiple regions to cache sessions and user progress, improving speed and reliability.
CloudWatch is set up to monitor everything and trigger auto-scaling when needed.
Payments are now handled through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store (at $36 per assessment module), so we’re dropping web-based payments.
The app uses API Gateway with Route 53 to route users to the nearest region for low latency.
Nova Micro (for writing assessments) can use local API calls based on the user’s region, but Nova Sonic (for speech-to-speech with Maya) is only available in North America for now, so it must be routed to us-east-1. We want users globally to access Nova Sonic, even if there’s some lag.
Note: We’re not storing users’ voices or conversations. Nova Sonic converts speech to transcript, assesses it, and only the written assessment is saved to the user’s profile in DynamoDB.
Clarification on Capacitor Wrap:
Since we’ve moved away from the Flask setup hosted directly on Replit and are now using AWS Lambda with API Gateway, the original Flask app is no longer the primary web view container. However, your mobile app (iOS and Android) still relies on Capacitor 7.3.0 to wrap the frontend and provide native features (e.g., microphone access for Nova Sonic, in-app purchases). You still need Capacitor to:
Package the app for Apple App Store and Google Play Store distribution.
Enable native plugins (splash screen, status bar, device access, network detection) that interact with the AWS backend.
Handle in-app purchase flows and user interface.
The Capacitor wrap is no longer directly tied to the Flask app but serves as the native shell for your mobile app, communicating with the Lambda-based backend via API calls.
What You Need to Update:
Switch to Regional API Calls:
Stop using the old Flask URL and start calling regional API Gateway endpoints (e.g., https://<regional-endpoint>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<stage>). Use Route 53 to figure out the nearest region based on where the user is and route the request there, except for Nova Sonic.</stage></region></regional-endpoint>
Structure Nova Sonic Calls for Global Access:
Route all Nova Sonic API calls to the us-east-1 region, no matter where the user is, since it’s only available in North America. Use Route 53 to enforce this for /nova-sonic/* endpoints.
Optimize for global access by adding buffering and retry logic to handle lag. Use the AWS SDK to implement exponential backoff (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s) and increase timeout settings (e.g., 10-15 seconds) to accommodate network delays.
Notify users about potential lag due to routing to North America and provide an option to continue or skip if the delay is unacceptable.
Ensure Nova Sonic converts speech to transcript, assesses it, and only saves the written assessment to the user’s DynamoDB profile (e.g., dynamodb.Table('IELTSUsers').update_item(Key={'user_id': '123'}, UpdateExpression='SET assessment = :a', ExpressionAttributeValues={':a': 'written_assessment_text'})). Do not store voice data or raw conversations.
Local API Calls for Nova Micro:
Allow Nova Micro API calls to use the nearest regional endpoint based on the user’s location, as it supports global access. Ensure it processes writing assessments and saves only the written results to DynamoDB.
Update Database Access:
Replace all PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy calls with DynamoDB API calls using the AWS SDK (Boto3). For example, save a user’s score with dynamodb.Table('IELTSUsers').put_item(Item={'user_id': '123', 'score': 85}). Make sure it works with DynamoDB global tables across regions and only stores written assessments.
Set Up ElastiCache:
Connect to ElastiCache Redis clusters (e.g., my-cache-cluster.abcd1234.0001.usw2.cache.amazonaws.com) to store sessions and temporary progress. Use a Redis client like redis-py to save data, like redis_client.set('session:123', 'data', ex=3600) for a 1-hour session. Do not cache voice data.
Handle App Store Payments:
Remove all web payment code. Instead, add support for in-app purchases:
For Apple, use the App Store Connect API to verify receipts with /verifyReceipt.
For Google, use the Play Billing API to check purchases with purchases.products.get.
After verifying a purchase, unlock the assessment module and save the status in DynamoDB. Integrate this with Capacitor’s InAppPurchase plugin.
Update Environment Settings:
In Replit’s Secrets tab, add AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) and set AWS_REGION to a default like us-east-1, but let the code pick the best region for most services. Add API Gateway URLs for each region and app store keys (Apple Shared Secret, Google Service Account JSON).
Add Retry Logic:
Include retry attempts (with exponential backoff) for API calls, especially for Nova Sonic, to handle Lambda cold starts, scaling delays, or network lag, using the AWS SDK’s built-in retry features.
Update Capacitor Integration:
Keep the Capacitor 7.3.0 wrap for iOS and Android, as it’s still needed to package the app and provide native features (microphone for Nova Sonic, in-app purchases). Update the web view to point to the new API Gateway endpoints instead of the old Flask app.
Ensure Capacitor plugins (splash screen, status bar, device access, network detection) work with the Lambda backend. Remove any Flask-specific logic from the Capacitor config.
Test Everything:
Use Replit’s live reload to test API calls across regions, including Nova Sonic routing to us-east-1 with global users (test with VPNs for Europe, Asia). Simulate in-app purchases via Capacitor and send logs to CloudWatch to check for errors or delays, focusing on Nova Sonic lag and ensuring only written assessments are saved.
How to Do It:
Rewrite the backend to work with Lambda, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache. Update all API routes to use the new regional endpoints, with special routing for Nova Sonic to us-east-1 and optimized for global lag tolerance. Ensure no voice data or raw conversations are stored—only save written assessments.
Update the Capacitor app to connect to the new API Gateway endpoints, keeping native features intact. Remove Flask dependencies from the web view.
