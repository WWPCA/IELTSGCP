# Domain Transfer Status for ieltsaiprep.com

## Current Status
- ✅ Auth code provided: `EEc6z@6q9XeUWe%:`
- ✅ Domain transferability confirmed
- ✅ Transfer request submitted (may have timed out but likely processed)
- ⏳ Processing status: Transfer request in progress

## What Happens Next

### 1. Email Notifications (Within 24 hours)
You should receive emails from both:
- **Namecheap**: Asking to confirm/authorize the transfer
- **AWS**: Asking to approve the incoming transfer

### 2. Manual Verification Steps
If you want to check the transfer status manually:

```bash
# Check for recent domain operations
aws route53domains list-operations --region us-east-1

# If you get an operation ID, check its status
aws route53domains get-operation-detail --operation-id <operation-id> --region us-east-1
```

### 3. Alternative Approach (If Transfer Didn't Start)
If no emails arrive within 24 hours, you can:
1. Try the AWS Console directly
2. Use AWS CLI with explicit parameters
3. Contact AWS Support for assistance

## Expected Timeline
- **0-24 hours**: Email notifications arrive
- **1-2 days**: Both parties approve transfer
- **5-7 days**: Transfer completes automatically
- **Final step**: AWS becomes the new registrar

## Important Notes
- Your website will continue working throughout the transfer
- DNS settings are already configured correctly
- No additional action needed from you until emails arrive
- Transfer cost: ~$12-14 USD (charged when approved)

## If You Need to Check Status
1. Log into your AWS Console
2. Go to Route 53 → Registered Domains
3. Look for transfer operations or pending transfers

## Backup Plan
If the transfer doesn't work, you can:
1. Keep the domain at Namecheap
2. Continue using Route 53 for DNS only
3. Your website will work exactly the same

The transfer process has been initiated - now we wait for email confirmations.
