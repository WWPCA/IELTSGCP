# Test Credentials Removed from Production UI

## Security Issue Fixed
Test credentials were being displayed on the production login page, which is a security risk.

## Changes Made
✅ **Removed test credentials section** from the login page template
✅ **Maintained all other functionality** including:
   - Professional gradient background and styling
   - Glassmorphism login card with backdrop blur
   - Home button for navigation
   - Mobile-first instructions
   - reCAPTCHA integration
   - Form validation and error handling
   - Responsive design

## Production Login Page Now Shows:
- Clean, professional interface without exposed credentials
- Mobile-first instructions for new users
- Secure login form with reCAPTCHA
- No test or demo credentials visible

## Backend Authentication Still Works
- Test credentials still function for internal testing
- Authentication logic unchanged
- Only the UI display was modified

## Deployment Details
- **Function**: ielts-genai-prep-api
