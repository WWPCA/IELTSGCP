# QR Authentication Testing Guide - Ready to Test Now

## Current System Status
✅ QR authentication system fully functional  
✅ Mobile purchase simulator available at `/test-mobile`  
✅ Website QR login at `/` (home page)  
✅ Assessment templates properly configured  
✅ Session management working (10-min QR expiry, 1-hour sessions)

## Quick Test Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Purchase-to-Website Flow (5 minutes)
1. **Open mobile simulator**: Visit `/test-mobile`
2. **Purchase assessment**: Click "Purchase - $36.00" on any assessment
3. **Wait for QR modal**: QR code appears within 3 seconds
4. **Open website**: New tab to `/` (home page)
5. **Authenticate**: QR scanner detects code automatically
6. **Verify access**: Redirected to profile with purchased assessment

### Test 2: Session Persistence (2 minutes)
1. **Complete Test 1** first
2. **Close browser tab** with website
3. **Reopen same URL** within 1 hour
4. **Verify**: Still logged in, no re-authentication needed

### Test 3: Multiple Purchases (3 minutes)
1. **Purchase first assessment** (Academic Speaking)
2. **Complete authentication** flow
3. **Return to mobile simulator**
4. **Purchase second assessment** (Academic Writing)
5. **Generate new QR code**
6. **Re-authenticate**: Both assessments now available

### Test 4: QR Code Expiry (12 minutes)
1. **Generate QR code** from mobile simulator
2. **Wait 11 minutes** (codes expire in 10 minutes)
3. **Try authentication**: Should show "QR code expired"
4. **Generate fresh code**: New authentication works

## Testing URLs
- **Mobile Simulator**: `http://localhost:5000/test-mobile`
- **Website QR Login**: `http://localhost:5000/`
- **Profile Page**: `http://localhost:5000/profile` (after auth)
- **Assessments**: `http://localhost:5000/assessment/academic_speaking`

## Apple Developer Integration Readiness

### When Account Approved (Day 1-2)
1. **Configure in-app products** in App Store Connect
2. **Create sandbox test accounts** for purchase testing
3. **Replace mock purchase flow** with real iOS StoreKit
4. **Test receipt validation** with Apple's sandbox servers

### iOS App Configuration
- Bundle ID: `com.ieltsaiprep.genai` ready
- In-app products: 4 assessments at $36 each configured
- QR authentication: Existing flow connects seamlessly
