### Overview

IELTS GenAI Prep is an AI-powered platform for IELTS test preparation. It offers assessment services for Academic and General Training IELTS. The platform is **migrating from AWS to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, transitioning from AWS Lambda to Cloud Run, DynamoDB to Firestore, and AWS Bedrock Nova to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash. The system supports QR code authentication for a seamless mobile-to-web user experience and utilizes AI for comprehensive evaluation across all IELTS criteria. The platform aims to provide high-quality, AI-driven assessment and feedback to help users prepare for the IELTS exam, with a focus on ease of access and consistent user experience across devices.
